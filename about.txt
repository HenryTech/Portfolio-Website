I am a self-starter who loves learning and solving problems. I know how to listen well, and am excellent at both written and verbal communication. Smiles come easily to me, and I'm engaging and easy to get along with.

My interests are wide-ranging and include movies, reading fiction and non-fiction, attending live music performances, cooking excellent meals, bicycling and hiking.

Although I've spent the last 18 years working in semiconductor manufacturing, I'm now attending The Tech Academy and am rapidly developing a working knowledge of over a half-dozen different programming languages.
